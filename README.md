MultiCloud--MultiCloud--Manage kinds of cloud storage
==========

Introduction:

This is the code project in the yahoo hack day!
We get the idea based on the need for managing many cloud storage. As more and more vendor provide free cloud storage, 
(if you stick to one and ignore others on your own, you are great.) it becomes a difficult job to manage them .
So this is the tools. It provide a unified access to lots of cloud storage. Besides you can enjoy a huge cloud storage for
free.

we provide a page to manage files from different cloud storage(previosly Dropbox,kuaipan).
the server is based on nodejs.  and also we provide a android app for synchronizing.

Details:
